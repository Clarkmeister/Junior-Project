# Junior-Project

A [link](https://github.com/UnstuckME/UnstuckME) to the repo for my junior project.

I worked on a team to develop a Windows application for student/tutor matchmaking and ratings. I worked on network connections, testing, debugging, and an SQL database. The project uses C#, the frontend was built with WPF and is connected to a WCF backend using a TCP connection. The SQL database is accessed using the Entity Framework.
